People call me Damar, I do mostly **front-end** and **machine learning**-related stuffs. I'm kinda too normal for techie people, but too techie for normal people.

Yes, I can center `div` without flex/grid. No, I've never had to invert a `binary tree` at my job. I write comments on codes whenever they're necessary
